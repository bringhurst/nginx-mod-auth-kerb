# nginx-mod-auth-kerb
This is an [nginx](http://nginx.org/) module to enable the use of SPNEGO,
GSSAPI, and Kerberos for HTTP SSO authentication.

*Warning*: This code probably has a ton of bugs. Personally, I suggest that you
don't use it in production without a bit of auditing. This repository was
created because the original download site disappeared.

## Compilation
First, you need to compile the spnegohelp dynamic library. 'make' in that
subdirectory should do it, then place it by hand somewhere where linker
and loader can find it by default (probably /usr/lib or perhaps even
/usr/local/lib depending on your setup).

When compiling from source build as usual adding the -add-module option:

````
  ./configure --add-module=$PATH_TO_MODULE
````

inside top Nginx source directory.

## Configuration
The module has following directives:

- auth_gss: "on"/"off", for ease of unsecuring while leaving other
  options in the config file,

- auth_gss_realm: what Kerberos realm name to use, for now only used to
  remove it from full user@realm.name,

- auth_gss_keytab: absolute path-name to keytab file containing service
  credentials,

- auth_gss_service_name: what service name to use when acquiring
  credentials. (TOFIX: HTTP but should be a list in case of some other
  browsers wanting perhaps khttp or http),

- auth_gss_format_full: "on"/"off", default "off", when "on" realm name will not
  be stripped from $remote_user variable

FIXME: for now they are all merely location specific. i.e. no way to
specify main or per server defaults, except for ...

## Examples
````
... current "hardcodeds" ;-}

    location /topsecret {
      auth_gss on;
      auth_gss_realm LOCALDOMAIN;
      auth_gss_keytab /etc/krb5.keytab;
      auth_gss_service_name HTTP;
    }
````
